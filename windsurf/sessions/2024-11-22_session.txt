Topic: Documentation Organization and File Structure

Changes Made
===========

1. Split Output by Section
-------------------------
- Implemented separate file creation for each documentation page
- Added file path preservation from source documentation
- Enhanced filename generation using document titles
- Added domain-based organization structure

File Changes
-----------
/src/crawler.ts:
- Added getDomainFolder() to create safe folder names from domains
- Added getRelativePath() to maintain source URL structure
- Modified generateFilename() to handle nested paths
- Updated file writing logic to create proper directory structure
- Enhanced logging with domain and path information

Directory Structure
------------------
New organization format:
output_folder/
  domain_name/
    docs/
      section1/
        page1.md
        page2.md
      section2/
        subsection/
          page3.md
      index.md

Technical Details
---------------
- Domain folders are created using sanitized hostnames
- All documentation is stored under a 'docs' subfolder
- Original URL paths are preserved under the docs folder
- Filenames are generated from document titles when available
- Index files are created for root/section pages
- Parent directories are automatically created as needed

Testing Notes
------------
The new structure has been tested with:
- Single page documents
- Multi-section documentation
- Nested directory structures
- Various domain names and URL patterns

Next Steps
---------
1. Test with various documentation sites
2. Consider adding metadata about the crawl source
3. Add support for documentation versioning
4. Consider adding a table of contents file

Roadmap Updates
-------------
- Marked "Split output by section" as completed
- Added new structure for better organization
- Maintained all existing functionality while improving organization
