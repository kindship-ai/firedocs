# Session 4: Testing Improvements and Roadmap Update

## Overview
Improved testing approach by switching to real SDK integration tests and updated project roadmap to reflect current progress.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Testing Improvements
- Replaced mock-based testing with real SDK integration tests
- Fixed async/await handling in tests
- Added proper event handling for crawl progress
- Improved test reliability and maintainability

### 2. Code Quality
- Fixed linting issues in FirecrawlClient
- Added proper JSDoc documentation
- Removed unused parameters
- Improved type safety

### 3. Roadmap Updates
- Marked completed API integration tasks
- Added new detailed tasks for UI and testing
- Added infrastructure tasks (CI/CD, telemetry)
- Better organized future development priorities

## Technical Decisions

### 1. SDK Testing Approach
- Switched from mocking to real SDK integration
- Benefits:
  * Tests real behavior instead of assumptions
  * Catches SDK interface changes early
  * Simpler test maintenance
  * Better integration coverage

### 2. Event Handling
- Used correct SDK event names:
  * 'document' for progress
  * 'done' for completion
  * 'error' for failures
- Properly typed CustomEvent handlers

### 3. Future Features
- Documented listCrawls as placeholder
- Added proper JSDoc explaining SDK limitations
- Prepared for future SDK updates

## File Changes

### Modified
1. `/src/test/suite/firecrawlClient.test.ts`
   - Removed mock-based testing
   - Added proper async/await
   - Used correct SDK events
   - Improved assertions

2. `/src/api/firecrawlClient.ts`
   - Updated listCrawls method
   - Added JSDoc documentation
   - Fixed linting issues

3. `/windsurf/roadmap.txt`
   - Updated completion status
   - Added new detailed tasks
   - Reorganized priorities

### Removed
- `/src/test/helpers/mockFirecrawl.ts` (no longer needed)

## Next Steps

### 1. Documentation Management
- Implement /docs folder structure
- Create storage system
- Add indexing functionality

### 2. UI Development
- Create progress indicator
- Add configuration interface
- Implement documentation browser

### 3. Testing Improvements
- Add UI component tests
- Write end-to-end tests
- Implement error handling

## Conclusion
This session significantly improved our testing approach and provided a clearer roadmap for future development. The move to real SDK testing will make our tests more reliable and easier to maintain.
