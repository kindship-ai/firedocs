SESSION PART 3: Test Infrastructure Improvements
----------------------------------------

COMPLETED TASKS:
---------------
1. Fixed ESLint Issues
   - Changed let to const for command variables in extension.ts
   - Updated naming convention for CONFIG_SECTION to configSection in configuration.ts

2. Improved Test Infrastructure
   - Simplified test runner configuration for better macOS compatibility
   - Removed dependency on @vscode/test-electron for basic tests
   - Updated test script in package.json to use Mocha directly
   - Fixed TypeScript type issues in test suite

KEY LEARNINGS:
-------------
1. VS Code Extension Testing on macOS
   - Complex VS Code test runners can be problematic on macOS
   - Simpler Mocha-based test setup is more reliable
   - Avoid using electron-specific test options when possible

2. Test Infrastructure Best Practices
   - Keep test setup minimal and focused
   - Use direct Mocha configuration instead of VS Code's test runner when possible
   - Handle file system operations carefully in test suite
   - Ensure proper TypeScript types for test frameworks

3. Code Quality Improvements
   - Consistent naming conventions improve maintainability
   - Prefer const over let for immutable variables
   - ESLint helps maintain code quality standards

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Implement Test Cases
   - Add tests for Configuration management
   - Add tests for Documentation View functionality
   - Add tests for Extension activation
   - Add tests for Command registration

2. Consider Test Coverage
   - Add test coverage reporting
   - Identify critical paths requiring test coverage
   - Plan integration tests for API interactions

TECHNICAL NOTES:
---------------
1. Test Setup Structure
```typescript
import Mocha from 'mocha';
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';

// Simple test runner setup
const mocha = new Mocha({
    ui: 'tdd',
    color: true
});

// File-based test discovery
files.filter(f => f.endsWith('.test.js'))
     .forEach(f => mocha.addFile(path.resolve(testsRoot, f)));
```

2. Package.json Test Configuration
```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "test": "mocha out/test/suite/index.js",
        "compile-tests": "tsc -p . --outDir out",
        "pretest": "npm run compile-tests && npm run compile && npm run lint"
    }
}
```

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
----------------------
- Test files should not contain sensitive information
- Mock API keys and credentials in tests
- Ensure test files are excluded from distribution

ENVIRONMENTAL NOTES:
------------------
- Development Environment: macOS
- Node.js Environment
- VS Code Extension Host

This session focused on improving the test infrastructure and establishing best practices for testing VS Code extensions on macOS. The simplified test setup provides a more reliable foundation for implementing actual test cases in the next phase.
