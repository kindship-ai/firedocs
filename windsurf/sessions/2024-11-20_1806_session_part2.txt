Session: November 20, 2024 - 18:06 (Part 2)
=====================================

Session Goals:
-------------
1. Complete Step 2 of roadmap: Core Extension Structure
   - Finish extension activation events
   - Complete configuration settings
   - Implement command palette integration
   - Set up secure API key storage

Current Focus:
-------------
Implementing core extension functionality and ensuring proper activation/configuration handling.

Completed Tasks:
---------------
1. Enhanced extension structure:
   - Created Configuration utility class for managing settings
   - Implemented DocumentationViewProvider for sidebar integration
   - Added file system watcher for docs folder
   - Set up proper activation events

2. Implemented core functionality:
   - Secure API key storage and management
   - Basic command palette integration
   - Documentation view in sidebar
   - Auto-indexing capability

3. Added new features:
   - Documentation explorer view
   - Auto-refresh on documentation changes
   - Improved error handling and user feedback

Current Status:
--------------
 Core extension structure complete
 Basic functionality implemented
 Ready for Firecrawl API integration

Testing Implementation:
--------------------
1. Created test infrastructure:
   - Set up test runner configuration
   - Created test suite structure
   - Added Mocha test framework integration

2. Implemented test suites:
   - Configuration tests
     * API key management
     * Default settings
     * Workspace path handling
   - DocumentationViewProvider tests
     * Tree view functionality
     * Refresh mechanism
     * Child item handling
   - Extension activation tests
     * Command registration
     * Tree view setup
     * Configuration presence

3. Test Coverage:
   - Core functionality tests
   - UI component tests
   - Configuration management tests
   - Extension lifecycle tests

Next Steps:
-----------
- Run the test suite to verify implementation
- Fix any issues found during testing
- Begin implementing Firecrawl API integration (Step 3)

Notes:
------
- Building upon the basic structure we created in Part 1
- Focus on security for API key handling
- Ensuring efficient extension activation
- Core structure is now robust and extensible
- Security considerations implemented for API key
- UI components in place for future functionality
- Auto-indexing will help keep documentation fresh
