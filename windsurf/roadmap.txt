FIREDOCS - VS Code Documentation Crawler Extension
================================================
A VS Code extension that leverages the firecrawl API to automatically crawl and store documentation websites locally. The extension provides a simple interface to crawl documentation sites and store them as markdown files in a local folder (default: /docs).
